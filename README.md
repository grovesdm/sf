# Slyfox Sass Framework

This is a set of reusable styling tools that I can use to develop sites as quickly as possible. 

The idea is to emulate something like tailwindcss but simpler. 


## Breakpoints

Less than (<)

Greater than (>)

Less than or equal to (<=)

Greater than or equal to (>=)



Naming of classes

## `.body`

This is the full html document height and width.
You can apply the default background colours. (i.e. outside the page)

## `.section`

100% width slices of the page. 
I have chosen this method as it may be necessary to have coloured sections that are full width.

## `.container`
 
There is a bunch of default container mixins in the ssf framework that can be used to control content inside of sections. See [here](https://github.com/grovesdm/ssf) for more.Use these to set the width of the content.
